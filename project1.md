# Problem Definition
In the United States and abroad I've noticed a steady increase in top-down anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment. This is to say that it's a project by those who hold power, not the everyday individual. I'd seen reporting that this mostly coincided with the 2021-2022 election cycle, with trans rights as a specific target. In setting out on this project I sought to answer two questions, with a bonus one if time allowed: How has the amount of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation changed over time, where, and to what effectiveness?

# Data Description
When looking for datatsets I found [this excellent table](https://doi.org/10.25949/24190026). It is a compilation of anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced into state (and Puerto Rico) legislatures through 2018-2025, with a basic description of the bills targets and progress. Keep in mind that this is _state level_, so neither federal legislation, executive orders, nor court decisions will be represented here. Here's a screenshot of the first row, for reference:
