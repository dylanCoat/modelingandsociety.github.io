i have no idea how to use GitHub Pages so please excuse its roughness. I will make sure it looks better as I work on it!

## Introductory post- 
Learning data science in social and interdisciplinary contexts matters because without those contexts data scientists only see numbers; not the lives behind them. It's far too easy and far too common for people working with large datasets to turn it into a numbers game---even more so in a corporate setting. Unwise data scientists find themselves prioritizing efficiency and optimization, totally disconnected from the implications of their work. All this is to say that non-technical education for data scientists is essential to ensuring that they stay humane.

I'm yet to know what this course really intends to delve into, so it's hard to have a realistic expectation of how I hope to be changed by it. One concrete thing is building up my skills with Python, statistics, and general data display and analysis. Beyond that I hope to be able to dive into a subject that I'm passionate about throughout this portfolio, so that I can learn more myself and create a resource for others to learn off of. But I think, deep down, the main thing I wish to take away from this course is a renewed hope in data science itself; this isn't to say that I find the discipline lacking in merit, no. Rather, so much of the data science education I've received thus far, regardless of the efforts to incorporate social and interdisciplinary contexts, has felt steeped in blind corporatism. That is not what I want my future to be. I know data science can have applications beyond finding ways for companies to extract more wealth out of consumers, but so far that aspect of data science has held such a spotlight. I don't just want the social contexts to serve as just a guide, those are where I thrive. Data science can be used for good, and I hope this course allows me to explore that.

## Space for other projects?
I'll probably figure out how to move those to separate clickable sections once I know what they actually entail. This space can serve as that in the interim.
